COMPACTION TASK:
Ignore the normal planner response format for this response.
Return strict JSON with:
{
  "time_anchor": string,
  "session_state": string,
  "active_goal": string,
  "active_commitments": string[],
  "durable_facts": string[],
  "relevant_people": string[],
  "open_loops": string[],
  "recent_timeline": string[],
  "forgettable_noise": string[]
}
Create a compact handoff checkpoint for continuing this exact thread later.
Preserve user constraints, operator instructions, active goals, open loops, important names, and current world/session state.
Prefer compressing assistant chatter, tool chatter, and stale notices.
Do not rewrite or quote the whole transcript.
Do not keep stale relative-time phrases such as "4 seconds ago"; convert them into stable facts or timeline notes.
Keep each list item short and concrete.
