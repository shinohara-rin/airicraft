# Airicraft

Airicraft is a Fabric mod that exposes an in-game agent bridge and a CLI for automating common tasks. It targets Minecraft `1.21.8` with Java `21`, plus a `wrapper/` CLI subproject.


## Development And Verification

Run these after Java is configured. Source `.envrc` before Gradle build, test, or run commands:

```shell
source .envrc
./gradlew --version
./gradlew build
./gradlew test wrapper:test --rerun-tasks
```

### Planner world inspection contract

The planner has a read-only `inspect_world` tool for exact local block state. It complements vision: use `take_a_look` for visual semantics, and `inspect_world` when the planner needs precise coordinates, block ids, block-state properties, or placement affordances.

`inspect_world` accepts fixed modes:

- `inspect_area`: compact exact local block records.
- `find_blocks`: exact `blockIds` plus optional `stateFilters` such as `age=7` or `moisture=7`.
- `find_placement_sites`: conservative candidate target positions using constraints such as `targetMaterial`, `supportBlockIds`, `supportStateFilters`, `requireAirAbove`, `requireStandableAdjacent`, `requireWithinInteractionRange`, and nearby required blocks.

Scopes are bounded to prevent broad world scans:

- `scope=self`: player origin with `horizontalRadius` and `verticalRadius`.
- `scope=center`: explicit `x/y/z` center with radii.
- `scope=box`: explicit `x1/y1/z1` and `x2/y2/z2` corners.

Every queried block must be within 64 blocks of the player. Radius defaults are 8 horizontal and 4 vertical, capped at 16 and 8. Search results default to 32 and cap at 64.

Planner-facing block modification is guarded by the world-read ledger. `place_block` and `use_block` take an intended modified target `x/y/z`; for example, planting seeds targets the crop position above farmland, while the runtime derives the support click. The target position must have been returned by `inspect_world` within the last 10 planner tool calls. If not, the runtime does not queue the modification. It returns a `place_block`/`use_block` tool result containing a small `inspect_world` `inspect_area` query centered on the target and tells the planner to call the same tool again only if it still wants to proceed.

### Evaluation scenario checks

Evaluation scenarios in `scenarios/*/scenario.yml` can use deterministic checks. `inventory_contains` verifies an item count, `block_state` verifies one exact block position, and `block_count` verifies at least `count` matching blocks in either `scope: self` with `horizontalRadius`/`verticalRadius` or `scope: box` with `x1/y1/z1/x2/y2/z2`.

Run scenarios through the batch harness. Parallel execution is opt-in with `--jobs`; the default remains one client:

```shell
scripts/run-evaluation-scenarios \
  --scenario pickup \
  --scenario underground \
  --recorder-jar /path/to/recorder-profile.jar \
  --jobs 2
```

Recorder-enabled runs require a recording profile. Set `AIRICRAFT_RECORDER_JAR`
to use the same profile without passing `--recorder-jar` each time. Use
`--no-recorder` to keep the existing run without integrated-server capture.

Each scenario gets an isolated bridge file, game directory, process, and artifact directory. Parallel runs stop every client. Recorder-disabled serial runs can leave the final client active unless `--stop-client-after-scenario` is set.

Recorder-enabled scenarios always stop their client after a terminal scenario
outcome. The runner writes the recorder and ServerReplay configuration into the
isolated game directory. The recorder artifact root is under that scenario's
result directory. Recorder-disabled scenarios keep the existing final-client
behavior.

The harness copies the base `run/config`, JourneyMap configuration, and `run/options.txt` into each worker. It does not copy saves, logs, screenshots, or JourneyMap world data. Passed worker directories are deleted. Failed, interrupted, and review worker directories remain under `run/evaluator-workers/<run-id>/`.

The scenario manifest and reports remain under `eval-output/<run-id>/`. Use each result's `workerId`, `clientPid`, `gameDir`, and `bridgeStatePath` to correlate live evidence.

To make frozen scenario worlds visible in the Minecraft singleplayer menu, unpack the archived fixtures into the dev game directory:

```shell
scenarios/unpack-worlds --dry-run
scenarios/unpack-worlds
```

By default this installs every frozen `scenarios/*/world.zip` archive into `run/saves/<scenario-id>` and marks the installed save read-only. The evaluator uses that visible frozen world as a menu entry, then loads a disposable copy for the actual run. To refresh an existing installed fixture, pass `--force`; to install only one scenario, pass its id:

```shell
scenarios/unpack-worlds farm_easy --force
```

### Normal dev client

Use this for Airicraft-only development. It runs the Fabric dev client with HotSwap and opens JDWP on `127.0.0.1:5005`.

```shell
source .envrc && ./gradlew runClient
jdb -attach 127.0.0.1:5005
```

### Realtime debug dashboard

Every Airicraft client starts its own read-only debug dashboard. The client binds the first available LAN port starting at `8765` and prints a clickable viewer-token URL in the log, in `airicraft status`, and once in Minecraft chat after a world loads.

The dashboard provides:

- full LLM request/response envelopes, parsed responses, failures, timing, and token usage
- embodied runtime, planner, conversation, task, mission, survival-reflex, behavior-tree, and action-graph snapshots
- semantic events, the correlated debug timeline, and Minecraft/Airicraft log history
- a global time cursor for inspecting all panels at an earlier observation
- bounded history with explicit eviction/gap reporting
- JSONL session export and replay through **Open session**

The dashboard is observation-only. It has a separate viewer token and does not expose the localhost bridge token or any bridge mutation route. Runtime state is sampled every five client ticks while discrete transitions are captured as they arrive. The browser keeps a recent memory-bounded window; **Save session** exports the full retained server history. A slow or disconnected browser never backpressures the game.

Configure it in `config/airicraft/airicraft.yml`:

```yaml
debugDashboard:
  enabled: true
  basePort: 8765
  portScanLimit: 100
  historyMegabytes: 64
  visualCaptureEnabled: false
  visualCaptureIntervalTicks: 20
```

Visual context is intentionally off by default because screenshot capture and PNG encoding cost more than structured observation. When enabled, it captures at most one correlated frame per configured interval. This development dashboard preserves raw LLM content and does not redact it.

### Main-mod HotSwap

All existing client tasks use HotSwap by default. This includes `runClient`, `scripts/compat run`, and `scripts/eval run`.

The first client start downloads these pinned development tools:

- JetBrains Runtime SDK `21.0.11-b1163.116` for macOS ARM64.
- HotswapAgent `2.0.3`.

Gradle verifies each download with a pinned SHA-512 value. It stores the files in the Gradle user cache.

Fabric uses its Knot class loader. HotswapAgent cannot watch Knot class roots directly.

The continuous Gradle task watches class output and sends changed classes through JDWP. HotswapAgent handles each class redefinition inside the client.

Use two terminals:

1. Start the required existing client task in the first terminal.
2. Start the continuous main-mod build in the second terminal:

   ```shell
   source .envrc && ./gradlew hotswapMain --continuous
   ```

3. Edit Java code under the main Airicraft mod.
4. Wait for a `HotSwap reloaded` message in the second terminal.

The client log also prints a `[redefine,class]` message. The first continuous run records the current class baseline.

The task watches named output for the normal client. It watches remapped root-mod output for each production client.

HotSwap has these limits:

- It supports macOS ARM64 only.
- The first setup needs network access. An offline first setup fails without a partial installation.
- Only main Airicraft mod classes reload.
- Evaluator-addon and compatibility-addon changes need a client restart.
- Mixin changes, resource changes, and Fabric initialization changes need a client restart.
- New classes, deleted classes, and superclass changes need a client restart.
- HotSwap does not run constructors or initialization code again for existing objects.
- A debugger and the Gradle uploader cannot attach to the same JDWP port at the same time.
- If no client is available, Gradle keeps the changes for the next `hotswapMain` run.
- A final evaluator proof needs a clean client start.
- A code change during an evaluator run invalidates that run as final evidence.

Use the official runtime sources when the pinned versions need an update:

- [JetBrains Runtime](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime)
- [JetBrains Runtime 21.0.11-b1163.116](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime/releases/tag/jbr-release-21.0.11b1163.116)
- [HotswapAgent 2.0.3](https://github.com/HotswapProjects/HotswapAgent/releases/tag/RELEASE-2.0.3)
- [Fabric HotSwap guide](https://docs.fabricmc.net/develop/getting-started/intellij-idea/launching-the-game)

### Agent debug CLI

The agent has turns, not ticks. These commands use the client tick as the only debug clock. Minecraft targets 20 client ticks each second.

A frame capture uses the first rendered frame for its client tick. The next client tick waits until that frame capture finishes.

Build the CLI before its first use or after a wrapper change:

```shell
source .envrc
./gradlew wrapper:installDist
AIRICRAFT_CLI=wrapper/build/install/airicraft/bin/airicraft
"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug --help
```

The Minecraft client and bridge must run for all commands. The `ticks`, `world`, and `trace` groups also need a loaded world.

The top-level commands have these uses:

| Command | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `chat --message <text>` | Inject one local-controller chat message. |
| `idle-trigger` | Start one idle-think planner trigger. |
| `state` | Show correlated planner, dialogue, chat, and task state. |
| `timeline [--since <entry-id>]` | Show recent debug events after an optional entry ID. |
| `ticks` | Pause, step, inspect, or continue client ticks. |
| `world` | Query the world for the current paused snapshot. |
| `trace` | Record selected debug information on each client tick. |

Add `--verbose` to a command when you need its full structured output. Use `--help` on any command group for its exact options.

#### Agent state and test triggers

Use these commands without pausing client ticks:

```shell
"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug chat --message '@agent get me 4 wood logs'
"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug idle-trigger
"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug state --verbose
"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug timeline --since 125 --verbose
```

The timeline cursor is exclusive. The command returns entries with an `entryId` greater than the `--since` value.

#### Pause and step client ticks

Pause the client and optionally write its captured frame to a PNG file. Add
`--player-actions` to capture actions and block break progress during this
pause session:

```shell
"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug ticks pause \
  --player-actions \
  --output-image /tmp/airicraft-pause.png
```

The response includes `debugSessionId`, `pauseEpoch`, `snapshotId`, and `clientTickId`. The `snapshotId` gives read-only access to the paused world.

`playerActions` contains action states for attack, use, pick, drop, hand swap,
and hotbar keys. Its optional `breakProgress` gives the block position, a
progress value from 0 through 1, a break stage from 0 through 9, and a
`started` flag. Each later `ticks step` keeps this capture option.

Use the returned session ID and pause epoch to run exactly one client tick:

```shell
"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug ticks step \
  --debug-session-id <debug-session-id> \
  --pause-epoch <pause-epoch> \
  --output-image /tmp/airicraft-step.png
```

Each step returns a new `pauseEpoch` and `snapshotId`. Use these new values for the next command.

Continue normal client ticks with the latest session ID and pause epoch:

```shell
"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug ticks continue \
  --debug-session-id <debug-session-id> \
  --pause-epoch <pause-epoch>
```

Use `ticks state` to inspect the current phase and identifiers:

```shell
"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug ticks state --verbose
```

A snapshot stays valid only while its client tick is paused. A step or continue command makes the old `snapshotId` stale.

#### Query a paused world snapshot

All world queries require the latest `snapshotId` from `ticks pause` or `ticks step`.

Get snapshot metadata or the full captured player state:

```shell
"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug world metadata \
  --snapshot-id <snapshot-id> --verbose

"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug world player-state \
  --snapshot-id <snapshot-id> --verbose
```

The player state includes identity, game mode, position, rotation, velocity, bounds, movement, and vitals. It also includes hunger, experience, abilities, input, inventory, equipment, effects, and attributes.

Query entities in a radius around the captured player:

```shell
"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug world entities \
  --snapshot-id <snapshot-id> \
  --radius 16 \
  --type minecraft:zombie,minecraft:skeleton \
  --alive \
  --limit 64 \
  --verbose
```

Omit the radius center to follow the captured player position. Set all three center coordinates to query around another position.

The radius can be from 0 through 4096 blocks. Use either a region or a radius in one query.

Query an arbitrary inclusive block region:

```shell
"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug world entities \
  --snapshot-id <snapshot-id> \
  --min-x -32 --min-y 50 --min-z -32 \
  --max-x 32 --max-y 100 --max-z 32 \
  --living-only \
  --limit 64 \
  --verbose
```

You can filter entities by `--entity-id`, `--uuid`, `--name`, `--type`, or `--alive`. You can also use `--living-only`, `--player-only`, and `--include-self`.

Name matching is exact and ignores letter case. Type matching uses an exact namespaced entity type ID.

The query excludes the local player unless you use `--include-self`. Results sort by distance and then by runtime entity ID.

Omit both spatial selectors to query all loaded entities. Use `--cursor` and `--limit` to page through the filtered result.

Entity pages contain 32 records by default and allow up to 256. Living entity records include vitals, equipment, effects, and attributes.

Read one block or query any region:

```shell
"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug world get-block \
  --snapshot-id <snapshot-id> --x 10 --y 64 --z -4 --verbose

"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug world scan-box \
  --snapshot-id <snapshot-id> \
  --min-x 0 --min-y 60 --min-z 0 \
  --max-x 31 --max-y 80 --max-z 31 \
  --limit 4096 --verbose

"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug world find-blocks \
  --snapshot-id <snapshot-id> \
  --min-x 0 --min-y 60 --min-z 0 \
  --max-x 31 --max-y 80 --max-z 31 \
  --block-id minecraft:diamond_ore,minecraft:deepslate_diamond_ore \
  --limit 4096 --verbose

"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug world region-stats \
  --snapshot-id <snapshot-id> \
  --min-x 0 --min-y 60 --min-z 0 \
  --max-x 31 --max-y 80 --max-z 31 \
  --limit 4096 --verbose
```

Region coordinates are inclusive. Region commands inspect 256 cells by default and allow up to 4096 cells per page.

Use the returned `nextCursor` as `--cursor` to read the next page. Unloaded blocks appear as unloaded records or unloaded counts.

#### Stream a client tick trace

A trace writes JSON Lines while normal client ticks run. The client keeps a rolling record buffer. The CLI polls it at 20 Hz and uses a buffered file writer.

Start a bounded trace for player state, nearby hostile entities, and client frames:

```shell
"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug trace start \
  --info metadata,player-state,entities,frame \
  --window-ticks 100 \
  --once \
  --output /tmp/airicraft-trace.jsonl \
  --entity-query '{"radius":16,"entityTypeIds":["minecraft:zombie","minecraft:skeleton"],"alive":true,"limit":64}'
```

Start a no-frame mining trace:

```shell
"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug trace start \
  --info metadata,player-actions \
  --window-ticks 120 \
  --once \
  --output /tmp/airicraft-mining-trace.jsonl
```

The file starts with a `trace_start` record. Each captured tick writes a `trace_record` record. The file ends with a `trace_end` record.

A frame record keeps `record.frame.imageBase64`. This keeps its screen render in the same output file. The stream holds a pending frame until its capture completes.

With `--once`, the client stops the trace after it records `--window-ticks` ticks. The command exits after it writes the final record and `trace_end`.

Without `--once`, the command continues to stream. Its initial response gives the `traceId`. Use another terminal to stop that trace:

```shell
"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug trace stop --trace-id <trace-id>
```

If the client buffer evicts unread ticks, the file writes a `trace_gap` record. This record gives the missing range boundary.

The supported `--info` values are `metadata`, `player-state`, `entities`,
`blocks`, `frame`, and `player-actions`. Repeat `--info` or use a
comma-separated list.

`player-actions` adds `record.playerActions`. It contains action states and
optional `breakProgress`. A direct attack or use call sets `started: true`. A
break progress record includes `position`, `progress`, `stage`, and `started`.

The client captures only selected trace information. A trace without `frame`
does not request a screen render.

An entity trace accepts an optional JSON query. Its fields match the paused entity query:

- Spatial fields: `minX`, `minY`, `minZ`, `maxX`, `maxY`, and `maxZ`.
- Radius fields: `centerX`, `centerY`, `centerZ`, and `radius`.
- Identity fields: `entityId`, `uuid`, `name`, and `entityTypeIds`.
- State fields: `alive`, `livingOnly`, `playerOnly`, and `includeSelf`.
- Result field: `limit` from 1 through 256.

Use either a region or a radius. A radius without a center follows the captured player on each client tick.

Without `--entity-query`, an entity trace keeps the nearest 32 loaded entities and excludes the local player.

Add a block region when the trace includes `blocks`:

```shell
"$AIRICRAFT_CLI" agent debug trace start \
  --info player-state,blocks \
  --window-ticks 40 \
  --once \
  --output /tmp/airicraft-block-trace.jsonl \
  --block-query '{"minX":0,"minY":63,"minZ":0,"maxX":7,"maxY":65,"maxZ":7}'
```

The general window limit is 1200 client ticks. A trace with frames has a limit of 200 client ticks.

A trace block region can contain at most 4096 blocks. The window size multiplied by its block count cannot exceed 250000.

The window size multiplied by the entity limit cannot exceed 100000. A trace cannot start while ticks are paused, and ticks cannot pause during a trace.

### Compatibility client

Use this for optional third-party mod integration testing. It launches a production-style Fabric client with the remapped Airicraft jar.

The client includes JourneyMap, REI, Fabric API, Architectury, Cloth Config, and local runtime mods. HotSwap uses JDWP on `127.0.0.1:5007`.

The helper keeps downloaded/runtime jars out of the repository in ignored `.airicraft-compat/`, and uses the shared dev game directory `run/`. That means normal `runClient` and compatibility runs read the same Airicraft config:

```text
run/config/airicraft
```

Common flow:

```shell
scripts/compat config
scripts/compat setup
scripts/compat mods
scripts/compat run
jdb -attach 127.0.0.1:5007
wrapper/build/install/airicraft/bin/airicraft status
wrapper/build/install/airicraft/bin/airicraft map status
wrapper/build/install/airicraft/bin/airicraft map image --kind worldmap --output /tmp/airicraft-worldmap.png
wrapper/build/install/airicraft/bin/airicraft map image --kind worldmap --origin-x 128 --origin-z -64 --output /tmp/airicraft-worldmap-origin.png
```

Expected smoke signal:

- Minecraft starts without a remap crash.
- Mod list includes `airicraft`, `airicraft-journeymap-compat`, `journeymap`, `airicraft-rei-compat`, and `roughlyenoughitems`.
- Wrapper status reports `available: true` and `bridgeAvailable: true`.
- `airicraft map status` reports `available: true` and `preferredProvider: journeymap`.
- `search_recipes` remains available to the planner while map tools are also available.
- `/tmp/airicraft-worldmap.png` exists and is non-empty after map image capture.

Do not copy optional-mod jars into `run/mods` or vendor them into this repository. Let `scripts/compat` sync the external jars into `.airicraft-compat/integration/`.

### Live JVM debugging with Arthas

Airicraft includes dev-only Gradle helpers for attaching the Arthas CLI to the running Minecraft dev client. Arthas is external tooling: it does not add a mod dependency and does not replace the Airicraft bridge or JDWP.

Start the client:

```shell
source .envrc && ./gradlew runClient
```

For a cold dev client, use the helper to start the client, wait for the bridge, join the first saved world, open LAN, and attach Arthas. This command is cold-only and fails fast if a client is already running:

```shell
scripts/arthas kickstart
```

Attach Arthas manually when the client is already running:

```shell
source .envrc && ./gradlew arthasAttach
```

Use the low-noise HTTP helper for probes after Arthas is attached. It auto-selects the Minecraft Arthas HTTP port when possible and prints compact results:

```shell
scripts/arthas --help
scripts/arthas v
scripts/arthas sc 'ai.moeru.airicraft.*'
scripts/arthas sm ai.moeru.airicraft.ModBridgeServer createStatusResponse
scripts/arthas w ai.moeru.airicraft.ModBridgeServer createStatusResponse
scripts/arthas raw 'thread -n 1'
```

If another JVM already owns the default Arthas port, pass the Minecraft port explicitly:

```shell
scripts/arthas --port 8564 sc ai.moeru.airicraft.ModBridgeServer
```

If process-name selection misses the dev client, find the JVM and attach by PID:

```shell
jps -lv
source .envrc && ./gradlew arthasAttach -Pairicraft.arthas.pid=<pid>
```

Useful Airicraft inspection commands include `sc`, `sm`, `jad`, `watch`, `trace`, `stack`, `tt`, `thread`, `dashboard`, and `ognl`.

Arthas starts with full command power by default. Mutation commands such as `ognl`, `vmtool`, `sysprop`, `vmoption`, `redefine`, `retransform`, and `mc` can alter the live JVM; use them deliberately. To restrict commands for a session, pass a comma-separated list:

```shell
source .envrc && ./gradlew arthasShell -Pairicraft.arthas.disabledCommands=stop,dump,heapdump,redefine,retransform,mc
```

```text
> ./gradlew runClient
The operation couldn't be completed. Unable to locate a Java Runtime.
Please visit http://www.java.com for information on installing Java.
```

## Weave / OpenTelemetry Observability Setup

Airicraft now supports optional LLM-call tracing via OpenTelemetry.
The default mode is vendor-neutral OTLP; if you want W&B Weave, you only need to switch a single profile in config.

### 1) Why this setup exists

- The `planner` and `vision` outbound requests emit spans with:
  - request metadata (provider/model/endpoint)
  - response metadata (status/usage tokens)
  - sanitized request/response summaries
  - failures and error typing
- `generic` profile exports only standard OTEL fields.
- `weave` profile adds a small set of Weave-friendly attributes.

### 2) Edit config

Airicraft writes/reads:

`config/airicraft/agent.yml` under the active Minecraft game directory.

For local development, both `runClient` and `scripts/compat run` use:

`run/config/airicraft/agent.yml`

The file is based on `src/client/resources/config/airicraft/agent.yml.example`.

A practical OTLP setup is already scaffolded in that template under `observability`.

### 3) Generic OTLP (default)

Set:

```yaml
observability:
  enabled: true
  exporter: "otlp_http"
  otlpEndpoint: "http://127.0.0.1:4318/v1/traces"
  otlpHeaders: {}
  vendorProfile: "generic"
  captureInputs: false
  captureOutputs: false
  captureImages: false
```

### 4) W&B Weave profile

Use this to send the same spans to Weave with minimal changes:

```yaml
observability:
  enabled: true
  exporter: "otlp_http"
  otlpEndpoint: "https://trace.wandb.ai/otel/v1/traces"
  otlpHeaders:
    wandb-api-key: "<W&B_API_KEY>"
  resourceAttributes:
    wandb.entity: "shinohara-rin"
    wandb.project: "airicraft"
  vendorProfile: "weave"
  captureInputs: false
  captureOutputs: false
  captureImages: false
```

For your project slug `shinohara-rin/airicraft`, set:

- `wandb.entity: "shinohara-rin"`
- `wandb.project: "airicraft"`

### 5) Optional data capture controls

- `captureInputs`: include sanitized input summaries.
- `captureOutputs`: include sanitized output summaries.
- `captureImages`: allow screenshot/tool-capture spans to export image payloads for media-capable backends like Weave. Regular LLM request traces still redact image bytes.

If all are false, only non-content structural tracing metadata is sent.

### 6) Reload workflow

1. Start Minecraft or keep existing session.
2. Edit `config/airicraft/airicraft.yml` and/or `config/airicraft/agent.yml`.
3. Run `airicraft reload` from the wrapper CLI, or `/airicraft reload` in-game.
4. The runtime reloads config live without restarting Minecraft; active agent state is reset during reload.
5. Confirm traces appear in your OTLP collector/Weave dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

### `./gradlew runClient` says `Unable to locate a Java Runtime`

Check:

```shell
java --version
which java
jenv version
jenv doctor
```

Fix:

1. Ensure `~/.zshrc` contains:
   - `export PATH="$HOME/.jenv/bin:$PATH"`
   - `eval "$(jenv init -)"`
2. Enable plugin and reload shell:
   - `jenv enable-plugin export`
   - `exec zsh`
3. Re-add JDK:
   - `jenv add /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home`
4. Re-select Java version:
   - `jenv global openjdk64-21.0.10`

### `jenv versions` only shows `system`

Cause: JDK not added into jenv, or shell init not loaded.

```shell
jenv add /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
exec zsh
jenv versions
```

### `JAVA_HOME` is empty

```shell
jenv enable-plugin export
exec zsh
env | grep JAVA_
```

If still empty, recheck `~/.zshrc` and run `jenv doctor`.

### `jenv` command not found

```shell
brew list jenv
cat ~/.zshrc | rg 'jenv'
exec zsh
which jenv
```

## Notes

- If `observability.enabled` is false, no OTLP network calls are made.
- If `otlpEndpoint` is empty or unsupported, observability is disabled at runtime with a warning.
- This integration is wired for outbound planner and vision API calls only.
